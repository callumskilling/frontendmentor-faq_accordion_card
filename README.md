## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a strange challenge because I started it a year ago and came back to it after finishing my Front End course. I didn't want to start again so I finished what I started but I think I would've tackled the structure differently if starting from scratch.

### Continued development

While CodeCademy does provide projects, they are less 'from scratch' like Frontend Mentor is, so I really just want to get lots of practice. In particular I feel like my JavaScript could have been a lot simpler. I did just want to complete this project though and it was working.
